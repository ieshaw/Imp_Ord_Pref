The intuition of this system is that market participants have common outlooks and drivers leading to a similarity of ranking. If we can calculate the similarity of each market participant with the others, we can use that as a correlation coefficient to predict their ordinal preferences as a linear combination of the ordinal preferences of the others. We take each person's expressed preferences as ground truth, and fill out the unexpressed ordinal preferences with this method.
