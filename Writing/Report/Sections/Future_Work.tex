We hope to extend this work to non-compelling situations, where participants can express preference up to a point, after which their preference is to not participate in the market. Futhermore, a future advancement could be to normalize the preference completion to be independent of certain factors such as race or geography. Furhter research could also be supported by a better experimental error metric than RMSE.
