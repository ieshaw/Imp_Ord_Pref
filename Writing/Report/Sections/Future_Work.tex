We hope to extend this work to non-compelling situations, where participants can express preference up to a point, after which their preference is to not participate in the market. Furthermore, a future advancement could be to normalize the preference completion to be independent of certain factors such as race or geography. Further research could also be supported by a better experimental error metric than RMSE. We are also curious as to why certain similarity measures preform better than others.
