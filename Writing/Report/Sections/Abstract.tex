This paper outlines a method by which to predict unexpressed preferences given only the expressed, ordinal preferences of one side of a market. With several datasets, the method is shown to be better than random. This is significant, as random assignment is the current default in the face of incomplete ordinal preferences. 


% This paper investigates the the possibility of uncovering implied ordinal preferences when provided incomplete ordinal preferences for one side of a matching market. The work of Gale and Shapely's \cite{gale_shapely} provided the first algorithm for solving the stable marriage and attempted the more general college admissions problems (verified as different problems by Roth \cite{canmp}). Much of the work in this field focuses on stability, which is not necessarily a requirement in systems where market participants are compelled \cite{incentives}. In situations of compulsion, the preference $u$ (un-assigned) is not an option. This arises in legally compulsory assignment situations such as jobs in the military or secondary school enrollment. 

% In these situation, complete ordinal preferences are not always provided. This can be due to a lack of time, lack of knowledge about preferences, excess of options, or some other system deficiency that does not encourage/enable participants to express preferences on all matching options. 

% This paper proposes a system where, given at least one preference for all participants on one side of the market, preferences may be supposed at a higher accuracy than random preference assumption.

% The code to demonstrate the matching algorithms, optimization, and preference-based metrics can be found in Ian Shaw's Github Repository. \footnote{\url{https://github.com/ieshaw/Imp_Ord_Pref}}
