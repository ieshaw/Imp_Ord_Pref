The plots below show the results of our experiments. As to be expected, RMSE increases with higher dropout percentage because less information in the system makes preference predictions less and less reliable. Interestingly, no similarity measure outperforms in each dataset. Until a compelling answer is found to this question, we recommend that any implementers of this system run this experiment on their dataset so as to decide on which similarity measure to use to complete their market's preferences. We also include a plot of running the same experiment on a dataset of random ordinal preferences. As per the intuition, since there are no underlying correlations between the columns, our method of using similarity measures performs exactly at the same rate as random guessing.
